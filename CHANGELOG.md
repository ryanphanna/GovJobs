## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New **Government of Canada (GC)** scraper support (federal jobs via PSC portal).
- New **Province of Ontario (OPS)** scraper support (provincial jobs via gojobs portal).
- New **Peel Region** scraper support (iCIMS portal).
- New **City of Burlington** scraper support (Avanti portal).
- New **Workday** scraper engine (added City of Brampton, Town of Ajax).
- New **Njoyn** scraper engine (added City of Vaughan, City of Oshawa).
- Expanded municipal coverage: Added Markham, Richmond Hill, Whitby, Milton, Guelph, and Kitchener.
- Total coverage expanded to **22 government job sources**.
- Transitioned to **Soft-Delete** data retention: stale jobs are now marked as "Expired" rather than being deleted from the database.
- Added **Inventory Job Filtering**: Ongoing recruitments and resume banks are now flagged in the database (`is_inventory`) and hidden by default in the UI to reduce feed clutter.
- Added "Ongoing/Inventory" toggle to the UI filters sidebar and an "INVENTORY" badge to associated job rows.
- New "Expired" UI status badge and dimmed styling for inactive job postings.
- Pagination support for **SuccessFactors** scrapers (now fetching 72+ City of Toronto jobs).
- Sequential scraping logic with fresh browser pages per source to eliminate network cross-talk and "interrupted navigation" errors.
- Intentional 1s delays between detail page requests to improve stability and avoid bot detection.
- Detailed per-source and per-item logging for improved debugging of extraction failures.
- Automatic "Scroll to Bottom" logic before pagination checks to reveal hidden buttons.
- Real-time progress tracking in console for long-running detail scraping tasks.
- Overhauled Federal/Provincial scrapers with multi-step "human-like" navigation to bypass session blocks.

### Changed
- Refactored Metrolinx scraper to target new **Oracle Cloud** portal (updated URL and selector strategy).
- Updated SuccessFactors scrapers for Toronto, TTC, and Mississauga to use `career17` subdomains.
- Standardized use of `textContent` and `Element` types across all scrapers for better cross-platform compatibility.
- Improved Job ID extraction logic to handle various URL formats and strip query parameters.

### Fixed
- Fixed critical "Module Not Found" errors by removing incorrect `.js` extensions from TypeScript imports.
- Fixed multiple TypeScript compilation errors (implicit 'any', possible null values in pagination).
- Fixed launch timeouts by switching to non-headless browser mode in local environment.
- Fixed Mississauga scraper picking up navigation links instead of job listings.
- Fixed York Region (HRSmart) pagination to capture all available listings across multiple pages.
- Fixed job detail rendering to support HTML descriptions (removed raw tag display).
- Fixed premature job expiration by increasing the freshness window from 10 minutes to 2 hours.
- Improved description parsing to strip hidden JSON metadata and script tags from portals like BambooHR.
- Improved Government of Canada (GC) descriptions by aggressively stripping out noisy "Share this page" social widgets and modification footers during the scraping phase.
- Fixed UI parsing bug where "Vacancies" would sometimes extract a full sentence with HTML tags; it is now strictly numeric or hidden.
- Removed fragile, regex-based "Qualifications" and "Responsibilities" extractions from the UI; the application now relies entirely on the beautifully rendered, clean HTML full descriptions.
- Standardized "ActionGroup" icons (Apply, Bookmark) consistent across list and detail views.

### Changed
- Moved all job metadata (Salary, Mode, Vacancies, etc.) into a focused left sidebar.
- Removed decorative icons from headers and panels for a more minimal, professional look.
- Refactored list rows to a clean, border-bottom style without boxed containers.
- Unified the "Apply" and "Bookmark" actions into a single group across the app.
- Standardized terminology to "Companies" throughout the entire application.

### Fixed
- Fixed persistent header baseline alignment for all navigation items.
- Fixed search bar clipping and "muddy" background issues.
- Fixed filter reset logic to clear filters without navigating away from the current view.
- Ensured `jobs.sqlite` is correctly ignored by git.
