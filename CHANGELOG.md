## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New **BambooHR** scraper support (migrated City of Hamilton to this platform).
- New **Taleo** scraper support (added Town of Oakville).
- Pagination support for **SuccessFactors** scrapers (now fetching 72+ City of Toronto jobs).
- Sequential scraping logic with fresh browser pages per source to eliminate network cross-talk and "interrupted navigation" errors.
- Intentional 1s delays between detail page requests to improve stability and avoid bot detection.
- Detailed per-source and per-item logging for improved debugging of extraction failures.

### Changed
- Refactored Metrolinx scraper to target new **Oracle Cloud** portal (updated URL and selector strategy).
- Updated SuccessFactors scrapers for Toronto, TTC, and Mississauga to use `career17` subdomains.
- Standardized use of `textContent` and `Element` types across all scrapers for better cross-platform compatibility.
- Improved Job ID extraction logic to handle various URL formats and strip query parameters.

### Fixed
- Fixed critical "Module Not Found" errors by removing incorrect `.js` extensions from TypeScript imports.
- Fixed multiple TypeScript compilation errors (implicit 'any', possible null values in pagination).
- Fixed launch timeouts by switching to non-headless browser mode in local environment.
- Fixed Mississauga scraper picking up navigation links instead of job listings.
- Standardized "ActionGroup" icons (Apply, Bookmark) consistent across list and detail views.

### Changed
- Moved all job metadata (Salary, Mode, Vacancies, etc.) into a focused left sidebar.
- Removed decorative icons from headers and panels for a more minimal, professional look.
- Refactored list rows to a clean, border-bottom style without boxed containers.
- Unified the "Apply" and "Bookmark" actions into a single group across the app.
- Standardized terminology to "Companies" throughout the entire application.

### Fixed
- Fixed persistent header baseline alignment for all navigation items.
- Fixed search bar clipping and "muddy" background issues.
- Fixed filter reset logic to clear filters without navigating away from the current view.
- Ensured `jobs.sqlite` is correctly ignored by git.
